# UCC Dashboard

The UCC Dashboard is a tool for analyzing UCC data, featuring a map that displays points of sale by HP, grouped equipment descriptions, and a Model Equivalents viewer that compares New Holland or Yanmar models to competitors by HP. Multipage setup provides additional pages for specific analysis of the UCC Data, ie. a snapshot of just the Big Baler data.
